We often celebrate coach and player performance, but it never hurts to give some love to our furry friends as well. The University of Washington football team boasts [4 National Championships](https://pac-12.com/content/pac-12-football-national-championships): 1960, 1984, 1990, and 1991. The first was under Coach Jim Owens and led by King Chinook, and the remaining three were under the duo of best boys, Don James and Sundodger Denali. Looking strickly at win percentages over their career, the original leader of pack, Frosty I, takes the cake with just under 75%, and close to giving [Nick Saban a run for his money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_football_coaches_with_a_.750_winning_percentage). I think the biggest takeaway from this analysis is that we hope Dubs II's bar will turn gold soon enough.
