Like most fellow Husky fans, I had long looked forward to September 5th, and the tailgates and renewed rivalries that would come with it. The football history of Washington and Michigan goes back over 60 years and [includes four iconic Rose Bowls](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/huskies-michigan-home-and-home-series-confirmed-for-2020-21/). Spending the day on my couch with my laptop wasn't what I had planned but is very on brand for 2020. To cheer myself up, I wanted to look back at our history against the Wolverines. It hasn't always been an even matchup (please ignore the first four games...) but has produced some great matchups as of late. I will keep my fingers crossed that a victorious trip to Ann Arbor will take place next fall, and that we can get the home portion of the series rescheduled. Seeing Jim Harbaugh quake in his khaki's in Husky Stadium is a sight I long to see.
