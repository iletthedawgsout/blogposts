Like most fellow Husky fans, I had long looked forward to September 5th and the tailgates and renewed rivalries that came with it. Spending the day on my couch with my laptop wasn't what I had planned but is very on brand for 2020. To cheer myself up, I wanted to look back at our history against the Wolverines. it hasn't always been an even matchup, but has produced some good games as of late. I will keep my fingers crossed that a victorious trip to Ann Arbor will take place next fall, and that we can get the home portion of the series rescheduled. Seeing Jim Harbaugh quake in his khaki's in Husky Stadium is a sight I long to see.
